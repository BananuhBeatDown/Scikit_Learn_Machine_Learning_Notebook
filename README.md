# Scikit_Learn_Machine_Learning_Notebook
A Jupyter notebook exploring machine learning techniques using scikit-learn and pandas libraries. Based off of scikit-learn video's from [Kevin Markham's No Free Hunch Kaggle Blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/author/kevin-markham/).

## Topics include:
- Machine learning terminology
- Requirement for working with data in scikit-learn
- Scikit-learn 4 step modeling pattern
- Model evaluation process
- Classification and regression supervised learning
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- K nearest neighbor
- Visualizing data using seaborn
- Using train_test_split to create training and testing sets from a dataset
- Interpreting model coefficients
- Making predictions
- Model evaluation metrics for regression
- Feature Selection
- Cross validation for model selection
- K-folds cross-validation
- Parameter tuning
- Using GridSearchCV  and RandomizeSearchCV to find the best model parameters
- Classification accuracy / Null accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification error, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate
- Classification threshold
- ROC Curves and Area under the curve
 
# Machine_Learning_with_Text_in_scikit-learn notebook
Building and evaluating predictive models from real-world text using scikit-learn, based off Kevin Markham's class at pycon 2016.

## Topic include:
- Model building in scikit-learn (refresher)
- Representing text as numerical data
- Reading a text-based dataset into pandas
- Vectorizing our dataset
- Building and evaluating models
- Comparing models
- Examining a model for further insight
- Practicing this workflow on another dataset
- Tuning the vectorizer (discussion)
