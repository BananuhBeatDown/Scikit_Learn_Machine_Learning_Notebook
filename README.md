# Scikit_Learn_Machine_Learning_Notebook
A Jupyter notebook exploring machine learning techniques using scikit-learn and pandas libraries. Based off of scikit-learn video's from Kevin Hartman's Kaggle Blog 

## Topics include:
- Machine learning terminology
- Requirement for working with data in scikit-learn
- Scikit-learn 4 step modeling pattern
- Model evaluation process
- Classification and regression supervised learning
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- K nearest neighbor
- Visualizing data using seaborn
- Using train_test_split to create training and testing sets from a dataset
- Interpreting model coefficients
- Making predictions
- Model evaluation metrics for regression
- Feature Selection
- Cross validation for model selection
- K-folds cross-validation
- Parameter tuning
- Using GridSearchCV  and RandomizeSearchCV to find the best model parameters
- Classification accuracy / Null accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification error, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate
- Classification threshold
- ROC Curves and Area under the curve
