# Scikit_Learn_Machine_Learning_Notebook
A Jupyter notebook exploring machine learning techniques using scikit-learn and pandas libraries. Based off of scikit-learn video's from [Kevin Markham's No Free Hunch Kaggle Blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/author/kevin-markham/).

## Topics include:
- Machine learning terminology
- Requirement for working with data in scikit-learn
- Scikit-learn 4 step modeling pattern
- Model evaluation process
- Classification and regression supervised learning
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- K nearest neighbor
- Visualizing data using seaborn
- Using train_test_split to create training and testing sets from a dataset
- Interpreting model coefficients
- Making predictions
- Model evaluation metrics for regression
- Feature Selection
- Cross validation for model selection
- K-folds cross-validation
- Parameter tuning
- Using GridSearchCV  and RandomizeSearchCV to find the best model parameters
- Classification accuracy / Null accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification error, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate
- Classification threshold
- ROC Curves and Area under the curve
 
# Machine_Learning_with_Text_in_scikit-learn notebook
Building and evaluating predictive models from real-world text using scikit-learn, based off [Kevin Markham's class at pycon 2016](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwizy_TN2d_OAhXK6CYKHdlUD8oQtwIILTAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWHocRqT-KkU&usg=AFQjCNGYcbaCozwxIbBqYm8r2eINb4vxAA&sig2=-G627kELKfiimy_kdt32-w).

## Topic include:
